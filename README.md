## Overview

This Unity-based project leverages the Mirror networking library to bring the beloved board game into the
digital realm. The key distinguishing feature of our digital adaptation is the use of AI to generate all cards
and illustrations, providing players with a fresh and dynamic gaming experience. The game is built with a
client-host architecture to accommodate multiple players, with one player acting as the host while others
join as clients.


## Features

- **Multiplayer Support:** Play Dixit with friends and family online.
- **Mirror Networking:** Utilizes the Mirror library for reliable and efficient networking.
- **Distributed Application:** Easily deploy the game for distributed play on various devices.
- **Digital Adaptation:** Captures the essence of the Dixit board game in a digital format.
- **Intuitive UI:** User-friendly interface for an enjoyable gaming experience.



## Project Components

The frontend part is made entirely in the Unity environment and contains a clear and intuitive UI so that the game is clear even to players who play it for the first time, the backend is made in the C# language and the client-host architecture is used, while the Mirror library is chosen as an intermediary between these two components. The project is based on an object-oriented principle, where each component represents an object on which events occur, thus the programming uses the event-driven paradigm. Commands and remote procedure calls are used to communicate with the server.
